# custom-utils
Custom system utils for shell

## How to setup

1. Download the package
2. Source `profile` in the root directory to add available pathes: `source /path/to/profile`
3. If necessary, add the previous command into your `.bashrc`

## Note

### On Mac OSX

This is designed for Linux. If use in Mac OSX, you need to install `coreutils`. (It's better to also install it on Linux)
